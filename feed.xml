                <p class="p1">I live close to Abney Park, a rambling Victorian cemetery in Stoke Newington. When I first came to Hackney in the late 70’s I lived in a house that backed onto the cemetery and while I was living there I painted the view from my bedroom window, that picture is called ’The Dead Tree' and it’s the first image to appear in the gallery below.</p>
<p class="p1">I have always been sympathetic to the Gothic imagination in both art and literature. I like ruins and overgrown cemeteries, twisted trees and cobwebbed staircases, places with atmosphere of abandonment and peaceful decay. For this reason I have painted a number of pictures inspired by Abney Park Cemetery.</p>

<p>This is my most recent Abney Park inspired picture. In the near future I'm hoping to post a better version as the painting is quite dark it's very difficult to photograph. At first sight one notices the sleeping lion first and then the various statues begin to appear in the half light. I worked on this painting off and on over a period of several years. In a future blog I'll be discussing the composition with some images of the work in progress.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/20/The-Art-Collector-2-2023-copy.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p class="p2">This picture was commissioned by an art collector who prefers to remain anonymous. The theme for this painting is female beauty and female power. Having a theme creates a focus. In this respect my picture is different from other paintings of collectors by artists such as Johann Zoffany (1733-1810), a German artist active in England during the first half of the 19th century. In his pictures the main subject is the collectors themselves and not the objects that they are collecting. The people in his pictures are often shown in discourse about art and culture surrounded by objects such as scientific instruments and old manuscripts and there will usually be references to music and philosophy. The intention is too show these man as being well educated and very much aware of the pre-Christian classical world, they are antiquarians with humanistic ideals. One such person is Sir John Soane and most of his collection is still intact and can be viewed by visiting his house at 13 Lincoln’s Inn Fields in London.</p>
<p class="p2">The composition of my painting was made up as I went along. As this subject is potentially complex I decided to start with a simple idea - the relationship between the collector and the largest picture in the background which is Titian’s ‘Venus of Urbino’. Later I decided to make it look as if some of the artworks are coming alive, hence Titian’s Venus is sitting up and about to step out of the frame. The sculpture coming to life immediately behind the collector is an idealised image of his wife, etc, etc.</p>
<p class="p2">The art collector seated at his desk is the only male presence in this picture with the exemption of Zeus (Jupitor) who appears as a swan and a shower of gold in the paintings of Leda and Danea. I have sifted through hundreds of images to find the material I needed to make this picture. Each picture that’s featured is intended to be seen in isolation but must also blend in with and complement the pictures and sculptures around it. I have taken liberties with many of the images, cropping and changing some of the details so that they fit in with my design. The scale of the paintings and sculptures in my picture has little connection with their sizes in real life. For example Velazques’ Rokeby Venus and Rodin’s Metamorphosis are both much larger in real life whereas the statue of Tara is much smaller. The drawing by William Russell Flint just off centre second down from the top would be about 3’ x 4’ according to the scale of things in my picture. In real life of course a drawing such as this probably measures about 18” x 24”.</p>
<p class="p2">Friends and associates have asked me about the source material for this painting so here are some brief comments about the artists whose work has contributed to the creation of this picture.</p>

<p class="p2">The Artists featured in the Art Collector</p>
<ol class="ol1">
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – sculptural bust photographed in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</li>
<li class="li3">Luis Ricardo Falero (1851-1896) – Falero is a Spanish painter who specialized in painting the female nude in mythological settings. This image is adapted from a painting of a witches Sabbath.</li>
<li class="li3">Kay Neilson (1886-1957) – Neilson is a Danish illustrator who was active in the so-called ‘Golden age of Illustration’ early in the 20<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> century. This image depicts a women being embraced by a demonic figure as she surrenders to the fire of her passion.</li>
<li class="li3">Paul Prosper Tillier (1834-1915) – Leda and the Swan – Tillier is a French artist noted for his paintings of mythological subjects.</li>
<li class="li3">Colin Murray – This picture has been created using a variety of sources.</li>
<li class="li3">William Russell Flint (1880-1969) – Flint is a Scottish artist who loved drawing and painting women especially in pastels and watercolour.</li>
<li class="li3">Gustave Boulanger (1824-88) – Phyrne – Boulanger is a French artist noted for his depictions of classical and oriental subjects. This painting is of Phyrne the most famous courtesan of the classical world. She lived in Athens in the 4<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> century BC and there are many stories about her. She was once prosecuted for blasphemy because she had impersonated the goddess Aphrodite.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Danae and the shower of Gold – According to Ovid Danae was locked up in a dungeon because of a prophesy that her first born would kill her father. However Zeus inflamed with lust descended from Mt Olympus and ravished her disguised as shower of gold. As a result of this encounter she gave birth to Perseus. It was Perseus who was to slay the Gorgon and rescue Andromeda.</li>
<li class="li3">Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) – Andromeda – This aristocratic English artist is noted for his exotic depictions of the female form. Like many of his contemporaries in the 19<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> century he was fond of classical and oriental subjects.</li>
<li class="li3">Albert Toft (1862-1949) – The Bather – Toft was a highly successful English sculptor. Toft described his work as being ‘idealist’ he also said that ‘to become an idealist you must necessarily first be a realist’. A viewpoint that I completely agree with.</li>
<li class="li3">Robert Auer (1873-1952) – Cleopatra – Auer is a Croatian painter who was very much influenced by Art Nouveau.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – This is most probably a Roman copy of a Greek sculpture now lost. It could be the figure of a Maenad or Bacchante, these were the wild female followers of Dionysus, or Bacchus if you prefer the Roman name for this god of wine and fertility.</li>
<li class="li3">Titian – Venus of Urbino – Tiziano Vecelli is known in English as Titian. This Venetian artist is one of the great masters of the 16th century. This painting caused a scandal when it was first exhibited because of the alluring way that the model is staring straight at the spectator. In my version she is sitting up and getting ready to step out of the painting. The background vignette identifies it as the ‘Venus of Urbino’. It appears that the servants of the goddess are engaged in some mundane task. One of them is rummaging in a chest whilst the other has a curtain draped across her shoulder. I like the way she is casually scratching herself.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Venus with the Beautiful Bottom – This is a Roman copy of a Greek sculpture. The original may have been by Praxiteles the 4<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> century Athenian sculptor said to have been the first person to sculpt a life size female nude. Phyrne is known to have modeled for him and she may well have posed for this piece.</li>
<li class="li3">Eric Gill (1882-1940) – Eve – Gill was a controversial English artist noted for his sculpture, printmaking and typeface designs. This wood block print shows Eve being tempted by the serpent.</li>
<li class="li3">Alphonse Mucha (1860-1939) – Selene – This Czech artist is considered to be the catalyst for the Art Nouveau artistic movement that began in Paris in the late 1880’s. This painting shows the moon goddess Selene looking rather coy.</li>
<li class="li3">Gaston Bussiere (1862-1928) – Nereids – Bussiere is a French Symbolist painter noted for his depictions of women in exotic, fantastical settings. In this painting a group of Nereids are about to surface. The Nereids are sea-nymphs and they are often shown with Poseidon the god of the sea.</li>
<li class="li3">Diego Velazques (1599-1660) – Rokeby Venus – This great Spanish master is especially noted for his portraits. He is an important artist in the art movement known as the Baroque.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Sculpture of a Dominatrix</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Aphrodite bathing – This sculpture is sometimes known as ‘Lely’s Venus’ since it once belonged to the Baroque portrait painter Sir Peter Lely. This piece was made in Rome in the second century AD from a Greek original now lost. It now resides in the British Museum and the version in my picture is painted from photographs I took myself.</li>
<li class="li3">Jami Aka – Dancer –<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jami Aka is a contemporary artist noted for his erotic sculpture.</li>
<li class="li3">Gilbert Baynes (1872-1953) – Frog Princess – This quirky piece of Art Deco was photographed by me in the Victoria and Albert Museum.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Girl eating an ice cream – This image is reminiscent of the Pop Art of the 1960’s.</li>
<li class="li3">Clodion (1738-1814) – Bacchante – Claude Michel was known as Clodion, this talented French Sculptor worked in the Rococo style.</li>
<li class="li3">Allen Jones (born 1937) – Girl Chair – Jones made a number of pieces that show women being made into items of furniture. His work is influenced by rubber fetishism and BDSM.</li>
<li class="li3">Jean Morisot (1899-1967) – Witch and Crone – Morisot is a French illustrator who produced numerous erotic drawings which were usually published in portfolio albums.</li>
<li class="li3">Auguste Rodin 1840-1917) – Metamorphosis of Ovid – This French sculptor was probably the last of the greats. He towered above his contemporaries and his work is yet to be eclipsed. The subject for this piece is unclear as it doesn’t refer to any specific story in Ovid’s Metamorphosis.</li>
<li class="li3">Colin Murray – This picture has been adapted from various sources.</li>
<li class="li3">Joseph-Charles Marin (1759-1834) – Bacchante and child – Marin was a French sculptor. He was a pupil of Clodion and his work echoes his master’s graceful Rococo style.</li>
<li class="li3">Ernest Nomand (1857-1923) – Nomand’s painting of the Pygmalian and Galatea story is the main inspiration for the sculpture in my picture. The pose is based on the famous Venus de Milo except that he has added the arms. The story appears in Ovid’s Metamorphosis and tells how Pygmalian, a sculptor, creates a piece of art that is so beautiful that he falls in love with it. He goes to the Temple of Venus and prays that his creation may have life. Venus answers his prayer and when he returns to his studio the statue is awakened by a kiss.</li>
<li class="li3">Franz Von Stuck (1863-1928) – Sensuality – This German artist is associated with the Symbolist movement. The femme fatale was a popular theme in Symbolist art.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Bunny sculpture.</li>
<li class="li3">Colin Murray – This Fine Art print is adapted from various sources.</li>
<li class="li3">P J Lynch (born 1962) – Death and the Maiden – This Irish artist has illustrated more than 20 books.</li>
<li class="li3">Edward Hodges Bailey (1788-1867) – Bailey was a prolific English sculptor who produced many public commissions including the statue of Nelson that stands on top of the famous column in Trafalgar Square.</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Erotic table</li>
<li class="li3">Unknown artist – Tara – Arya Tara is a female Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism where she is known as the ‘mother of liberation’ and represents the virtue of success in work. She is also used as a Tantric Meditation Deity by the practitioners of the Vajrayana branch of Tibetan Buddhism.</li>
<li>Colin Murray – Mermaid Bathing – This is a classic image of a mermaid based on one of my own designs.</li>

            <![CDATA[
                    <p><img src="https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/19/Green-Man-2023-copy.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p class="p1">The Green Man represents the spirit of nature and rebirth. It pre-dates Christianity and exists in many cultures all around the world. In my picture I’m concerned with the European tradition. The Green Man is associated with Jack in the Green, John Barleycorn, Robin Goodfellow and Puck. The Green Knight from Arthurian legend and Robin Hood share aspects of the Green Man’s nature. So does Father Christmas, originally a representative of a tree spirit his robes were always green. The Jack in the Green is part of the May Day parade and relates to customs practiced by the Celts and the Druids. The Green Man is often seen amongst the carvings in many Christian churches and cathedrals built in medieval times. It seems that the builders and craftsmen had no problem mixing Christian faith with the old ways.</p>
<p class="p1">A painting like this is put together from many sources. I’ve used photographs that I have taken myself, images from books and from the internet. Putting together the source material is much easier than it used to be. Thanks to digital technology I can easily upload the images I wish to use and doctor them in Photoshop. I can put images into reverse if need be. I can create my own enlargements and print off onto A4 paper. When I was painting my Orpheus playing to the Animals picture, back in 1995, I had to use books to find my source material. I remember buying wild life books cheaply in second hand bookshops. These days if I want to look at pictures of butterflies I can look on the internet and many such images appear.</p>
<p class="p1">My Green Man is made of oak leaves. I looked at botanical drawings in order to construct the head. As human heads are more or less symmetrical I’ve used an arrangement of leaves that is similar on each side. Once the head was established I started to paint in more leaves using some photographs I had taken. Then I began to think of adding insects. I love painting butterflies so they were the first to go in followed by a ladybird and a stag beetle. Finally I put a nightingale into the top right corner to represent the birdsong that I associate with woodlands. When using photographic images it’s important to use an image that will work within the eye level of the picture. So you appear to be looking down at leaves and insects in the lower half of the picture and up at what is in the upper part of the painting. If possible I like to make use of the space that is outside of the picture, this is tricky to do it involves creating a sufficient illusion of reality amongst the foliage so that the butterflies appear to float in space.</p>
<p>I've painted several T shirts based on my Green Man design. I'll be discussing fabric painting technique in a future blog.</p>

                    <p><img src="https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/Self-Portrait-Feb-1977-2.jpg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p class="p1">I remember the old adage, ‘a picture paints a thousand words’, but not any more, now an artist needs a thousand words to explain why he painted a picture. So in this and succeeding blogs I’ll be talking about some of my paintings.</p>
<p class="p1">I was born in 1956 and I began painting in oils when I was twelve years old. When I was seventeen I attended a two-year Foundation Course and I have a Ba Honours degree in Fine Art. I also have a City and Guilds Teaching Certificate and I have taught in schools and also given private tuition. I teach basic drawing skills, especially from life, and painting and drawing technique as these are things that can be taught. In future blogs I’ll be looking at the ways of whys of painting technique.</p>
<p class="p1">I have had many exhibitions over the years and I’ve been in group shows however I’m not going to bore you with the details in this blog.</p>
<p class="p1">My work is figurative and I paint various kinds of pictures sometimes from life and sometimes I use photographic references. Regarding the use of photographs thanks to home printing it is much easier to produce the source material I need for my pictures. I cannot conjure a complex realistic scene purely from my imagination so I study various images and adapt them to my purpose a good example of this is my recent picture ‘Memento Mori’.</p>
<p class="p1">As to where I stand in terms of contemporary art I’ve realised that I have more in common with Outsider Art than with any other trend, when I consider that I’m largely self-taught, most of my work is obsessively detailed and I have always operated outside of the mainstream. However my work has proved popular among a small group of business people and private collectors.</p>
<p class="p1">When I was going through some of the many paintings still in my possession I found an early self portrait painted in February in 1977. Also I discovered an image of one of my psychedelic pictures, between 1977 and 1980 I painted many such pictures but I now have only a few snapshots of most of this work.</p>
<figure class="post__image" ><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"  src="https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/Panic-Street.jpg" alt="Panic Street" width="2560" height="2299" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 90vw" srcset="https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Panic-Street-xs.jpg 384w ,https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Panic-Street-sm.jpg 600w ,https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Panic-Street-md.jpg 768w ,https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Panic-Street-lg.jpg 1200w ,https://colinmurrayartist.com/media/posts/18/responsive/Panic-Street-xl.jpg 1600w"></figure>

</figure>
<p class="p1">But why paint? Being an artist is not a career path for most people. And the UK is not really an artist friendly environment. I’ve been painting or drawing pictures since I was about 7 or 8 years old. Why? The reason I paint is because I have too have some way of escaping reality and entering into the world of my own imagination. In a way it helps me to justify my existence as a human being and most importantly the pictures I create are unique, only I could have made them. Whether or not the world needs my art is a question that is still waiting to be answered.</p>
